    A single development is unlikely to fulfil all the priorities for the local area. It's useful to be able to demonstrate which priorities are important to residents, so they can push developers to be more ambitious with their targets. Telling us what your priorities are can help planners make that decision.

    The number of self contained homes that are being proposed. This includes affordable, social and private housing. Larger schemes might have a range showing the minimum and maximum number of homes if the total number is going to be decided later.

  <p
    class="govuk-body"

    Affordable housing is a term used to cover different types of housing that are less costly than housing on the private market. This might be social rented housing, affordable rented housing or housing which the government helps people to buy a proportion of. It can be shown as a proportion of the total number of homes, or as a proportion of the total residential floorspace.
